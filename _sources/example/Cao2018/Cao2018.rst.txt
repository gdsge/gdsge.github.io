Cao (2018): Speculation and Wealth Distribution under Beliefs Heterogeneity

The models that we have seen so far are models with rational expectations. Our toolbox can be used to solve models without rational expectations. A recent example is `Cao (2018) <https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/128/614/2258/5230957>`_.

The Model
===============

The model in `Cao (2018) <https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/128/614/2258/5230957>`_ is 
similar to the one in `Heaton and Lucas (1996) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/262030>`_ with several main differences. 
First and foremost, the two representative agents might differ in their beliefs on the transition matrix for the exogenous Markov process. 
Therefore, it departs from the rational expectations assumption. `Cao (2018) <https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/128/614/2258/5230957>`_ uses agent index :math:`i\in \{\text{O},\text{P}\}`, which stands for optimists or pessimists. 
Second, the agents  are subject to a collateral constraint, besides the short-selling constraint:

.. math::
    b^i_{t+1}+(1-m)s^i_{t+1}\min_{z^{t+1}|z^t}(p^s_{t+1}+d_{t+1})\geq0,

where :math:`m\in(0,1)` denotes the margin requirement when agents purchase stock with leverage. 

We use the toolbox to solve the version of the model in Example 4 in `Cao (2018) <https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/128/614/2258/5230957>`_ with :math:`m=0.1`. The constraints imply that wealth shares always lie between :math:`0` and :math:`1`.

The gmod file 
=================

The model is solved with :download:`Cao2018_HL.gmod <Cao2018_HL.gmod>`

.. literalinclude:: Cao2018_HL.gmod
    :linenos:
    :language: GDSGE

This should look familiar if you already saw the :ref:`Heaton and Lucas (1996)<HL1996>` example 
(our toolbox algorithm to solve their model is also different from their original algorithm).
The new element of the model, heterogeneous belief, is incorporated in the following two lines

.. literalinclude:: Cao2018_HL.gmod
    :lines: 89-89
    :lineno-start: 89
    :language: GDSGE

.. literalinclude:: Cao2018_HL.gmod
    :lines: 93-93
    :lineno-start: 93
    :language: GDSGE

As shown, the *GDSGE_EXPECT* function takes an optional argument following operator | to explicitly specify the transition matrix 
(with the default option given by *shock_trans*).
In the current example, the transition matrix used by the optimists and pessimists are defined in *shock_trans1* and *shock_trans2*, respectively. Notice *shock_trans1* and 
*shock_trans2* need to be explicitly declared as *parameters* to be used in the model block.

==================
Results
==================

The following figure shows the equity premium as perceived by the optimists and the pessimists. The optimists believe that the likelihood of high dividend payment is higher than the pessimists do. Therefore, the optimists' perceived equity premium is always higher, and they borrow from the pessimists to invest in stock.

In the ergodic distribution of wealth share in the following figure, using the pessimists' beliefs as the correct beliefs, the optimists own large fractions of total wealth despite the fact that their beliefs are incorrect (because return to equity is higher than return to bond when the optimists' wealth share is relatively low).
