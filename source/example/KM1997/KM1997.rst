Kiyotaki and Moore (1997): Credit Cycles
****************************************

In `their seminal 1997 paper <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262072>`_, 
Kiyotaki and Moore put forth a model of credit cycles in which movements in asset prices interacts 
with the real side of the economy and produce amplified and persistent effects of shocks to the economy.

Their original model is relatively simple with risk-neutral agents and one-time unanticipated MIT shocks.
`Peter Frank Paz <https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-paz-365311125/>`_, a Ph.D. candidate from New York University
proposes a more modern extension of the model with risk-averse agents and recurrent aggregate shocks.
The model fits squarely in GDSGE framework and Peter kindly contributed his gmod file below.

As in  `Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262072>`_
the economy consists of two production sectors, farming and gathering, with population
of each sector normalized to one. The farmers are more productive, but are less patient than the gatherers 
and thus they tend to borrow from the gatherers in equilibrium. 

A farmer solves

.. math::
    \max_{\{x_t,k_t,b_t\}}\mathbb{E}_{0}\left[\sum_{t}\beta^{t}\frac{\left(x_{t}\right)^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}\right],
    
subject to the budget constraint:

.. math::
    x_{t}+q_{t}k_{t}+\frac{b_{t}}{R_{t}}=y_{t}+q_{t}k_{t-1}+b_{t-1},
    :label: eq:budget farmer
    
in which her resource is from production 

.. math::
    y_{t}=A_{t}\left(a+c\right)k_{t-1},

the value of land holding :math:`q_{t}k_{t-1}`, and bond holding :math:`b_{t-1}`.
The aggregate TFP shock :math:`A_{t}` follows a Markov process. She allocates
her resource among consumption :math:`x_{t}`, as well as land and bond
holding into the next period. As in `Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262072>`_, here
portion :math:`c` of the output is non-tradable and has to be consumed,
i.e.,

.. math::
    x_{t}\geq A_{t}ck_{t-1},
    :label: eq:nontradable constraint KM

and only the remaining portion :math:`a` is tradable. She is also subject
to the following collateral constraint:

.. math::
    b_{t}+\theta\underline{q}_{t+1}k_{t}\geq0.
    :label: eq:collateral constraint KM

in which :math:`\underline{q}_{t+1}` is the lowest possible land price
in the next period. In `Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262072>`_ 
:math:`\theta` is set at :math:`1` but we allow :math:`\theta` to be smaller than :math:`1` in this extension
so that the collateral constraint binds with positive probability in the ergodic distribution of the model dynamics.

Similarly, a gatherer solves

.. math::
    \max_{\{x_{t}^{\prime},k_{t}^{\prime},b_{t}^{\prime}\}}\mathbb{E}_{0}\left[\sum_{t}\left(\beta^{\prime}\right)^{t}\frac{\left(x_{t}^{\prime}\right)^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}\right],

subject to the budget constraint,

.. math::
    x_{t}^{\prime}+q_{t}k_{t}^{\prime}+\frac{b_{t}^{\prime}}{R_{t}}=y_{t}^{\prime}+q_{t}k_{t-1}^{\prime}+b_{t-1}^{\prime},
    :label: eq:budget gatherer

in which her production function is concave,

.. math::
    y_{t}^{\prime}=\underline{A}_{t}\left(k_{t-1}^{\prime}\right)^{\alpha}.

We assume the gatherers' productivity :math:`\underline{A}_{t}` is inferior,
and equals to a fixed proportion of :math:`A_{t}`, i.e., :math:`\underline{A}_{t}=\delta A_{t}`
with :math:`\delta<1`. 

Let us denote the multipliers on the farmers' budget constraint :eq:`eq:budget farmer`
as :math:`\beta^{t}\lambda_{t}`,  and on the tradability constraint :eq:`eq:nontradable constraint KM`
as :math:`\beta^{t}\eta_{t}`, and on the collateral constraint :eq:`eq:collateral constraint KM` as
:math:`\beta^{t}\mu_{t}`. Because the farmers and gatherers' optimization problems are 
globall concave maximization problems, the following first order conditions 
and complementary-slackness conditions are neccessary and sufficient for optimality:

.. math::
    \left(x_{t}\right)^{-\sigma}-\lambda_{t}+\eta_{t} & =0,\\
    \eta_{t}\left(x_{t}-ck_{t-1}\right) & =0,\\
    -q_{t}\lambda_{t}+\theta\underline{q}_{t+1}\mu_{t}+\beta\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \left(q_{t+1}+a+c\right)\lambda_{t+1}-c\eta_{t+1}\right]&=0,\\
    -\frac{1}{R_{t}}\lambda_{t}+\mu_{t}+\beta\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \lambda_{t+1}\right]&=0,\\
    \mu_{t}\left(\theta\underline{q}_{t+1}k_{t}+b_{t}\right)&=0,\\
    \beta^{\prime}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \left(\frac{q_{t+1}+\alpha\left(k_{t}^{\prime}\right)^{\alpha-1}}{q_{t}}\right)\left(\frac{x_{t+1}^{\prime}}{x_{t}^{\prime}}\right)^{-\sigma}\right]&=1,\\
    \beta^{\prime}R_{t}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \left(\frac{x_{t+1}^{\prime}}{x_{t}^{\prime}}\right)^{-\sigma}\right]&=1.

The total land supply is fixed at :math:`\overline{K}`, and the market
clearing conditions are 

.. math::
    b_{t}+b_{t}^{\prime} & =0,\\
    k_{t}+k_{t}^{\prime} & = \overline{K},\\
    x_{t}+x_{t}^{\prime} & = Y_t = A_{t}\left(a+c\right)k_{t-1}+\underline{A}_{t}\left(k_{t-1}^{\prime}\right)^{\alpha}.

We define recursive equilibrium over two endogenous state variables.
The first-one is the farmers' land-holding :math:`k_{t-1}`. 
The second one is the farmers' financial wealth share defined as 

.. math::
    \omega_{t}=\frac{q_{t}k_{t-1}+b_{t-1}}{q_{t}\overline{K}}.

We use :math:`\left(k_{t-1},\omega_{t}\right)`
as the endogenous state variables, instead of :math:`\left(k_{t-1},b_{t-1}\right)`
in order to avoid multiple equilibria problems. 
(The multiple equilibria problem in a similar setting is studied previously 
in `Cao, Luo and Nie (2019) <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3531341>`_.) 

In the numerical exercise, we choose the shock process of TFP :math:`A_{t}`
to be I.I.D., and :math:`A_{t}\in\left\{ 0.99,1,1.01\right\}` with probability
:math:`1/3` for each possible value. In
the ergodic distribution, the probabilities for binding collateral
constraint conditional on the three values of :math:`A_{t}` are 92\%, 80\%
and 77\% respectively. Thus the collateral constraint is more likely
to be binding when :math:`A_{t}` is low.

The IRFs after positive and negative
1 percent TFP shocks (flipped for negative shocks) are plotted below by averaging the conditional
responses over the ergodic distribution (using the method 
from the :ref:`Guerrieri et al. (2020)<GLSW2020>` example
in the following :download:`MATLAB file <main_simulate_KM1997_irf.m>`).

    :scale: 40 %

Although the TFP shocks are symmetric and temporary, 
the IRFs show that their effects are asymmetric and persistent thanks to
market incompleteness and the collateral constraint :eq:`eq:collateral constraint KM`.
In a more realistically calibrated model, 
`Cao and Nie (2017) <https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150219>`_  study
the importance of market incompleteness and collateral constraints in producing these effects.
They found that market incompleteness is relatively more important than collateral constraints.
